    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will apply a **Neural Network (NN)** to a **credit risk dataset** to predict credit risk. You will preprocess the data, train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, optimize its performance, and use SHAP to interpret feature importance. The aim is to understand how different features impact credit risk predictions and to evaluate the model's accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "In this section, you will train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to predict credit risk. The MLP model includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Model Structure**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Input Layer**: Receives input data (features).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Hidden Layers**: Two hidden layers to capture complex patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Output Layer**: A single neuron with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification (credit risk: low or high).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Activation Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use **ReLU** in hidden layers to introduce non-linearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Sigmoid** activation in the output layer for binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Training and Backpropagation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Forward Pass**: Pass the input data through the network to get predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Loss Calculation**: Use binary cross-entropy as the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Backpropagation**: Adjust weights to minimize loss using an optimizer (e.g., stochastic gradient descent).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Preventing Overfitting**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Regularization (`alpha`)**: Apply L2 regularization to avoid large weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Early Stopping**: Stop training when validation loss stops improving.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Cross-Validation**: Use grid search to find the best parameters (e.g., `hidden_layer_sizes`, `alpha`).\n",
